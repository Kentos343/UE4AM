\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item learn how you build a dedicated server in ue4 so read this\-: \href{https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Standalone_Dedicated_Server}{\tt https\-://wiki.\-unrealengine.\-com/\-Standalone\-\_\-\-Dedicated\-\_\-\-Server} and this\-: \href{https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Dedicated_Server_Guide_(Windows_%26_Linux)}{\tt https\-://wiki.\-unrealengine.\-com/\-Dedicated\-\_\-\-Server\-\_\-\-Guide\-\_\-(\-Windows\-\_\-\%26\-\_\-\-Linux)}
\item get familiar with php and take a deep look on \hyperlink{class_u_e4_a_m}{U\-E4\-A\-M} framework in php (this thing) you need the php script to handle communication between the clients and the account. so you feed your client / player state with all needed account player info you received by your php script
\item to make life easier in U\-E4, download V\-A\-Rest from ufna which gives you the possibility to handle json in blueprint \href{https://github.com/ufna/VaRest}{\tt https\-://github.\-com/ufna/\-Va\-Rest}
\item write a blueprint actor class where you handle all functions needed, like registeraccount, login, etc. these functions communicate with your php script you wrote before
